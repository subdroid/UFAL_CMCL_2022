# CMCL 2022

## What has been done in the past?

## CMCL-21


## How do we approach?

The winner of last year's CMCL was a Belgian who did not use any DL methods on the problem. But most other solutions extensively used DL. Our plan of action is to use both of those approaches. So we first start off with a Baseline. And then we incrementally develop our solutions. One problem that should be considered even before creation of the baseline is the selection of an appropriate regression model. So we would start with all the regression methods that we can start with.

### Baseline
The baseline for the task would simply use the training data over some regression models to check for performance.
